# LangGraph-Based MDAgents Rewrite: Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for rewriting the MDMAgents system using LangGraph 0.6.6. The current system uses custom classes and manual orchestration to implement three processing modes (basic, intermediate, advanced). The new implementation will leverage LangGraph's state management, multi-agent orchestration, and control flow primitives for better scalability, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Current System Analysis

### Architecture Components
- **Agent Class**: Individual LLM wrapper supporting OpenAI and Gemini models with token tracking
- **Group Class**: Collection of agents with collaborative capabilities  
- **Processing Functions**: Three separate functions for basic, intermediate, and advanced processing
- **Token Management**: Global and per-agent token usage tracking
- **State Management**: Manual state passing between processing steps

### Processing Modes
1. **Basic Mode**: 3-expert recruitment + arbitrator system (87.05% accuracy)
2. **Intermediate Mode**: Expert collaboration with multi-round debate (78.67% accuracy)  
3. **Advanced Mode**: Multi-disciplinary teams with coordinator (75.76% accuracy)

### Key Features to Preserve
- High accuracy performance across all modes
- Token efficiency and tracking
- JSON-based communication between agents
- Adaptive difficulty assessment
- Multi-provider LLM support (OpenAI, Gemini)

## Target LangGraph Architecture

### Core Design Principles
- **State-First Design**: Use LangGraph's StateGraph for explicit state management
- **Agent Specialization**: Each agent type as a dedicated node with specific capabilities
- **Hierarchical Orchestration**: Supervisor pattern for coordinating specialized agents
- **Command-Based Control**: Use LangGraph's Command objects for dynamic routing
- **Memory Management**: Leverage checkpointing for conversation state persistence

## Technical Implementation Details

### LangGraph Integration Patterns

#### State Management
```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState
from langgraph.types import Command
from typing import Literal, List, Dict, Optional

class MDMState(MessagesState):
    question: str
    difficulty: Optional[str] = None
    experts: List[Dict] = []
    token_usage: Dict = {"input": 0, "output": 0}
    stage: str = "start"
    final_answer: Optional[Dict] = None
```

#### Agent Node Pattern
```python
def create_expert_node(specialty: str):
    async def expert_node(state: MDMState) -> Command:
        # Expert analysis logic
        response = await expert_agent.analyze(state.question)
        
        return Command(
            update={
                "experts": state.experts + [response],
                "token_usage": update_tokens(state.token_usage, response.usage)
            },
            goto="next_stage"
        )
    return expert_node
```

#### Supervisor Pattern Implementation
```python
def supervisor_node(state: MDMState) -> Command:
    if state.difficulty == "basic":
        return Command(goto="basic_processing")
    elif state.difficulty == "intermediate": 
        return Command(goto="intermediate_processing")
    else:
        return Command(goto="advanced_processing")
```

## Implementation Constraints

### File Modification Rules
**⚠️ CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: 
- **DO NOT modify main.py or utils.py**
- **ALL LangGraph code must be in NEW files**
- Use naming pattern: `langgraph_*.py` for new modules
- Create `langgraph_main.py` as new entry point when ready

### File Structure
```
MDMAgents/
├── main.py                 # PRESERVE - original entry point
├── utils.py                # PRESERVE - original utilities  
├── langgraph_mdm.py        # ✅ NEW - core LangGraph infrastructure
├── langgraph_main.py       # NEW - LangGraph entry point (future)
├── langgraph_basic.py      # NEW - basic processing graph
├── langgraph_inter.py      # NEW - intermediate processing graph  
├── langgraph_advanced.py   # NEW - advanced processing graph
└── test_langgraph_*.py     # NEW - test files
```

### Development Guidelines
**NEVER**:
- Modify main.py or utils.py files
- Import/modify existing processing functions directly
- Mix LangGraph and legacy code in same file

**ALWAYS**:
- Create new files for LangGraph implementation
- Keep implementations cleanly separated
- Follow TDD approach with comprehensive tests
- Update plan documentation as progress is made

### Environment Management Rules
**CRITICAL REMINDER**: 
- `source venv/bin/activate && python3 -m pip install` ✅ **Correctly installs in venv**
- `python3 -m pytest` (separate command) ❌ **Uses system Python** 
- `venv/bin/python -m pytest` ✅ **Always uses venv Python**

**Issue**: In Claude Code bash execution, each `Bash` tool call is a separate shell session, so `source` activation doesn't persist between commands.

**Solution**: Always use `venv/bin/python` and `venv/bin/pip` directly to ensure virtual environment isolation.
